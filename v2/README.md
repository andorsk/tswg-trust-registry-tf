# Placeholder TRTF README v2


## OpenAPI Specification

The first "concrete" API specification is an Open API Specification v3 YAML file.

## Logical Model



## Integration Model

As the TRP is a protocol, those systems that don't natively support it can be connected via "bridge". 

An early example is shown below:
![C4 Systems Model - showing native TRP support on one system, bridged support to two other systems (TRAIN and EU Trusted List ARF)](../out/v2/logical/protocol-bridging/protocol-bridging.svg)
