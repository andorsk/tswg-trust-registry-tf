# Trust Registry Task Force

## Objective

The objective of the Trust Registry Task Force is to develop the `ToIP Trust Registry Protocol` as a ToIP Layer 3 `trust task` protocol that enables
standardized interactions with a `trust registry`.

The purpose of a `trust registry`is to enable participants in a `trust community` to obtain `authoritative information` about that community's
`governance framework` and `governed parties`.
